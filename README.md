I am trying to make a command-line Chess program. **It's DONE**!!

I worked on saving the "en passant" pawns, so when you reload the game an "en passant" move is still possible.

The code is written in the Chess_code folder and files to help me edit the program with Visual Studio are in the Chess2 folder.

In order to make it easier to debug, the main function is written outside the Chess_code folder.
I debug this game locally with the [Catch2](https://github.com/catchorg/Catch2) library.
The developers of that library deserve fantastic credit!
