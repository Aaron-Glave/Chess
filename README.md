I am trying to make a command-line Chess program. There's still a long way to go. I want to:
- Detect whether it is possible to get out of check when I am in check
- Make pawns which can upgrade
- Make bishops and queens.
- The main branch contains code I use often in many programs.
That's a lot of work for me to do.
