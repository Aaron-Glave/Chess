Space numbering:
The top right square is row 8 column 8 and the bottom left square is row 1 column 1.
> Note that when I ask for the row and column,
> I read the numbers from a top-down perspective with the white team on the bottom.
> When you have to enter a row or column, you must be very precise.
> You can't type anything after the single number character.
When castling is a legal move for you, you can castle by typing the word castle with no punctuation.
> The game will ask you whether you want to castle left or right.
> Castling left always involves the rook in column 1,
> and castling right always involves the rook in column 8.
You can be killed. Or you can hug!
You can surrender by typing the word surrender.
Or if your opponent agrees, you can tie by typing the word tie.
Or you can make kings hug by helping them land on the same space and meet,
> or by typing the word hug instead of selecting a piece.
Command line arguments:
--hug: Display that the kings can hug when starting the actual game!
>  Hugging is a secret move. Think of it as a reward for being nice.
God answered my prayers and helped me make this game. He deserves credit!
